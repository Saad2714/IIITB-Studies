			  Project  Report  

Introduction:
My project is based on Node.js . It uses express framework ,bodyparser ,passport and multer as middleware.
The bcrypt library on npm makes it really easy to hash and compare passwords in Node.js. Router is simple node.js module which refers to how an application’s endpoints(URl) respond to client’s request , and many more libraries of node.... along with mongoose/mongoDB to create DataBase.


Problem Description:
The main motivation behind this project is inconvenience facing everyday for asking doubts regarding studies only with teachers or friends or seniors. Digitalisation of the process of asking doubts was also another motive. In my class around 1:11 is a ratio of non shy people to shy people regarding asking doubts in class.I also come in non asking doubts comminity, I understand the importance of asking doubts  .... ANONYMOUSLY... which helps a lot in his/her studies.


Solution Proposed:
A basic website which allowes everyone to ask any type of question regarding studies,answer any question and an option of upvote also.. A simple basic version of Stack Overflow community with following changes:
1. Purely Anonymous...but if someone started fun we can track him/her.
2.Restricted to IIITB or a batch of class or some specific professors only...
   (Planning to upgrade this subject wise...where anyone can join and related professors will be there)
3.An option of upvoting only(not downvoting ..we can create it ...but not a good idea to downvote someone)
4.A user profile with profile photo , safety as authentication /login is required with a token for asking doubts or answering question or upvoting..



Execution:
1. Node.js and it’s various modules and libraries were used to create the basic layout for complete backend

2. MongoDB or mongoose/mLab was used to create a DataBase(512MB online with a user id IIITB)


Conclusions:
1. I learnt that it is difficult for someone to create a full big project by itself...Team members and their coordiantion is needed..
2. I learnt different types of frameworks.. more about database. Now I am more fluent with the basics of backend web development..
3. Really this project which I started in holidays ...taught me many things,and improved me a lot ...
